# Save The Penguin Game
This is a final project for the subject Object-Oriented Programming which uses Scala programming language. 

This assignment stipulates the design of a system by the identification of the classes required and the relationships among them. I have applied my knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism in the implementation of the solution. At the same time, I also used scalaFX GUI library to create a GUI Application.
